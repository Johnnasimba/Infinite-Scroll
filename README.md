The goal of this project is to show how to implement infinite scroll functionality. This is something that happens a lot on social media. As the user scrolls near the bottom of the page, a network request is made but it happens in a way that you don't see it such that you feel like you are scrolling forever. The images are photos fetched from Unsplash API. 

If you hover over an image you can see a short description and if you click on it you can see that image on the Unsplash website with its full details.  

The site is mobile responsive such that you can open it on any device.
